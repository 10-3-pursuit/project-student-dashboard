## Existing code

This project includes some existing code that will help you complete the features below.

- [`Data Shape`](./dataView.md): This file contains the shape of each object. The data you will be working with is an array of objects. Your data will consist of as many as 90 students. Some important key's include:
  - `id`: A unique ID associated with each student.
  - `profilePhoto`: A randomly generated photo from [Random users](https://xsgames.co/randomusers/).
  - `cohort`: An object represents which "cohort" the student is in. It includes the `cohortCode`, `cohortStartDates` and `cohortScores` which you will need to work with.
  - `notes`: This is an array of note objects holding a commenter's name and their comment. Keys are `comment` and `commenter`
## Advice

When building a project, there are additional skills to be gained alongside the tech you are learning. In this project, your ability to do the following will be observed:
How you:

- plan out your approach with your team before coding
- break large features into small, testable tasks that you can build
- synthesize multiple skills you've learned at once
- learn new skills and syntax on your own
- manage your time and stay focused on the important tasks
- check in consistantly with your time to make sure you are building the same application together
- To ask for help

**Without a good strategy, programming can be very difficult**

### Suggested process

## PROCESS

**STUDY THE DATA CAREFULLY!!!**

You will have to maneuver and massage this data. You cannot simply just render the valuse 'as-is'


Use all of the tools you have been given to create a plan of action for your team. Trello, Github, Ideation Board, etc.

Continue to slowly iterate, making small changes to complete each feature. Commit often, so that you can always undo your changes if you break something big.
