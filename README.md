# Student Dashboard Project

## Welcome to the Student Dashboard!

### On the landing page, you will see a list of all the students in the program. Above that list, you will find how many students are listed. Each students have their full name, email, and birthday displayed. There is also an indicator for if the student is "On Track to Graduate" when they have their graduation requirements met.

### To the left of the page, there is a list of each cohort sorted by the season and year. Each season and year shows each student that belongs within that cohort.

### When you click each student, you will be taken to a different view. There you will find a table with details about their Codewars, scores, and certifications. Below that table is a form where you can enter the name of the author of the comment and the comment. Once a comment is submitted, it will be added to a thread below the form.
